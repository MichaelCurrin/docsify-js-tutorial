# Vue Integration
> Basic tutorial and demo of how to add Vue to your Docsify site


## Resources

Based on the tutorial in the DocsifyJS docs - [Compatible with Vue](https://docsify.js.org/#/vue).

See also the [Vue.js homepage](https://vuejs.org/).


## Back to main tutorial

Done looking at Vue? Go back to the <a href="/">DocsifyJS Tutorial</a>.


## Note

This app's `index.html` file exists to make this work as a standalone example, but really you would only have a single `index.html` file across the whole site.

Also things with colors and menu can get weird switching between sites.
