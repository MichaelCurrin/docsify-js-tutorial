# Docsify Template
> How to build a docs site with _Docsify-JS_ and Github Pages

Convert your docs folder into a pretty docs website using [Docsify-JS](https://docsify.js.org/) and some minimal setup instructions. This project's doc site itself running on _Docsify_.

This project aims to use easy instructions for newcomers to Docsify and also includes as little effort as possible to get the quickstart / template project copied into your own project.

## Tutorial

The tutorial is available in two forms:

- Github Pages: [docs site](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/docsify-template/#/). This also live demo of the kind of site you would have after completing the tutorial.
- Project docs: View the docs as plain markdown format in the repo, either locally or on Github. See the [docs](/docs) directory.

The tutorial references the [quickstart](/quickstart) at the project root.
