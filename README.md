This project will guide you to convert your project's docs folder into a pretty docs website. This project's own docs site is built on _Docsify-JS_ so serves as a good example.


## üéØ Project aims

The idea is to add as little code as possible, to make it easy to maintain and quick to get going. The tool used here is [Docsify-JS](https://docsify.js.org/) but no prior knowledge is needed, so this is ideal for newcomers.

The tutorial covers the basics and provides minimal setup instructions. You can add the quickstart project to your **existing** docs folder. If you doc files are markdown files, you don't have to rename them and their formatting can mostly stay the same (links may need updating).

Unlike static site builders like Jekyll or Hugo, you do not need to install or run a site generator or change the formatting or metadata of your markdown files. Your also don't need any config files - the configuration is handled in the _index.html_ page, which is also where dependencies are fetched in the browser and where the app starts.

_Docsify_ works as a single-page application on this one page - data from your markdown files is pulled in and displayed within the _Docsify_ UI shell. There are no template layout files to manage.


## üë©‚Äçüè´ Follow the tutorial

The tutorial is available in two forms:

- Github Pages: [docs site](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/docsify-template/#/). This also live demo of the kind of site you would have after completing the tutorial.
- Project docs: View the docs as plain markdown format in the repo, either locally or on Github. See the [docs](/docs) directory.

The tutorial references the [quickstart](/quickstart) directory at the project root.

See also the [Nested Example](/nested_example/README.md) section for understanding links in markdown and the sidebar.
