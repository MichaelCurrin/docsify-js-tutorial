# Docsify Template
> How to build a docs site with _Docsify-JS_ and Github Pages

This project provides instructions on how to turn the docs directory of your project into a docs site hosted on Github Pages, using this site's configs and structure as a starting point.


## Documentation

- Online docs: [Github Page site](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/docsify-template/#/). This is both a tutorial as well a live demo of the kind of site you would have after following the tutorial.
- Project docs: Start at the [readme](/docs/README.md) in the [docs](/docs) directory. These docs lack _Docsify_ styling but contain the same content as they are used in serving the online docs site.
